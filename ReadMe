**Path of Light Yoga Studio Website**

This repository contains the code for a simple Path of Light Yoga Studio website.

    Project Overview

The website provides basic information about the yoga studio, including:

*   Information about the studio and its philosophy.
*   Details about the types of yoga classes offered.
*   A link to a schedule page (presumably `schedule.html`).
*   A link to a contact page (presumably `contact.html`).
*   Contact information (address and phone number).
*   Copyright information.

    Files Included

*   `index.html`: The main landing page for the website.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the website's appearance.
*   `classes.html` (Linked): A page detailing the different yoga classes.
*   `schedule.html` (Linked): A page for the class schedule.
*   `contact.html` (Linked): A page with contact information and possibly a form.

    How to View

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository)

2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    Code Structure

      HTML (`index.html`):
    *   Basic HTML5 structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
    *   Includes meta tags for character set and title.
    *   Links to the `style.css` stylesheet.
    *   Contains a header with the studio name.
    *   Includes a navigation section with links to other pages.
    *   Uses a `<main>` element for the primary content of the home page.
    *   Includes a list of features/offerings.
    *   Displays contact information.
    *   It contains a footer with copyright and an email link.

      CSS (`style.css`):
    *   Contains styles to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the website. (Note: The provided HTML only shows the structure; the actual styling is in `style.css`).

   Notes and Potential Improvements

*   Semantic HTML: The current HTML has some areas that could be improved for better semantics and accessibility (e.g., using `<header>` and `<nav>` more consistently, ensuring proper heading hierarchy, using a `<form>` for the contact page).
*   Accessibility: Consider adding ARIA attributes and ensuring sufficient color contrast for better accessibility.
*   Responsiveness: The current code doesn't include responsive design techniques (like media queries). This would be necessary to make the website display well on different screen sizes.
*   Contact Form: The `contact.html` page would likely need a form element to allow users to send messages. This would require server-side processing as well.
*   Image Assets: The current code doesn't include any images. A real-world yoga studio website would likely feature Images.
*   Content: The placeholder text in the "About" section should be replaced with actual content about the studio.
*   Navigation: The navigation links are just bold text separated by spaces. Using a `<ul>` and `<li>` structure within the `<nav>` element is the standard and more semantic approach.
